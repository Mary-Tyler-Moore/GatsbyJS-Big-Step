      "Big Step Recovery believes that recovery from substance use is possible for everyone, regardless of how much or how long a person has been using alcohol or other drugs, regardless of age, gender, race, social status, economic status, belief system, education level, familial status, sexual identity, or life experience. Dignity and respect are the hallmarks of our treatment approach; personal accountability and self-determination are the benchmarks of our program success. We believe that long-term recovery is sustainable only as a part of a productive and meaningful life, as defined by the person in recovery. Emotional wellness, social engagement, financial wellbeing, intellectual development, creative pursuits, physical activity, spiritual growth, and independent living are common in a life of sustained recovery.  Big Step works with each individual to identify what a whole life looks like for them, and helps them to begin working towards achieving individual goals, resilience, and self-sufficiency through skill-building, personal mentoring, individual and group counseling, and participation in mutual support and 12-step groups.
