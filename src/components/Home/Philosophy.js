        Big Step Recovery believes that recovery from substance use is possible
        for everyone, regardless of how much or how long a person has been using
        alcohol or other drugs, regardless of age, gender, race, social status,
        economic status, belief system, education level, familial status, sexual
        identity, or life experience. Dignity and respect are the hallmarks of
        our treatment approach; personal accountability and self-determination
        are the benchmarks of our program success.

        We believe that long-term recovery is sustainable only as a part of a
        productive and meaningful life, as defined by the person in recovery.
        Emotional wellness, social engagement, financial wellbeing, intellectual
        development, creative pursuits, physical activity, spiritual growth, and
        independent living are common in a life of sustained recovery. Big Step
        works with each individual to identify what a whole life looks like for
        them, and helps them to begin working towards achieving individual
        goals, resilience, and self-sufficiency through skill-building, personal
        mentoring, individual and group counseling, and participation in mutual
        support and 12-step groups.

        Our program is a strengths-based program. We focus on what’s strong, not
        what’s wrong. The Big Step approach is anchored in a traditional
        twelve-step philosophy, and we encourage active self-reflection and work
        with a sponsor, but we have enlarged the traditional recovery residence
        treatment model to emphasize the importance of engagement with the
        outside world. We believe the opposite of addiction is not sobriety, but
        human connection. We begin by building relationships within the recovery
        residence, with family and recovery allies, and then building out into
        the community through employment, volunteer work, and voluntary
        participation in the faith community.

        Big Step recognizes that trauma is a significant part of the personal
        history of many with substance use disorder. Other mental health
        challenges may also impact both addiction and recovery. We work with
        medical professionals to provide regular assessments of individuals with
        special behavioral health challenges to make certain they are receiving
        the right treatment, in the right amount, at the right time. We honor
        the service of our veterans, and we do not consider post-traumatic
        stress syndrome an insurmountable barrier to long-term recovery. We work
        with veterans and their families to make certain the care they receive
        recognizes the sacrifices they have made.

      <div className={styles.center}>
        We believe strongly in peer recovery supports. One person in long-term
        recovery using their lived experience to inspire, inform, and guide
        another is still the best model for achieving and maintaining long-term
        recovery. And long-term residential treatment settings like Big Step are
        still the best environment for people who have been unable to achieve
        and maintain long-term recovery after brief recovery interventions such
        as medical detox or traditional 28-day programs.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div className={styles.center}>
        As rewarding as it is to see lives transformed, families rebuilt, and
        hope restored, we would much rather live in a world without addiction,
        and focus our passion elsewhere. Today, our vocation is helping people
        overcome addiction to create lives of purpose and meaning. Until there
        is a single, proven cure for addiction, we will continue to work to help
        as many people as we can, using the best recovery practices and
        treatment modalities, with empathy and compassion. We know that not
        every place is right for every person—when someone is not making
        progress at Big Step, we work with them and the people in their lives to
        find the place that is the right fit. We believe that every person has
        the right to recovery, and we work hard to make that a reality for every
        person who walks in our door.
