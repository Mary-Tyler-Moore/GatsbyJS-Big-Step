This is a crazy project. But I'm very happy overall. I do need to set up a webhook so that Netlify will know to rebuild my site whenever new content is published in Contentful.

Until I set up the hook I will trigger a rebuild of the site by updating the README.md.

Working on Styles now. im going to push up the new code i wrote last night.
